# Map Web App

The workout web app with Running and Cycling tracking features is designed to provide users with an easy and convenient way to monitor their fitness progress. The app's tracking features help users keep track of their performance and set realistic fitness goals.

**Distance**: This feature allows users to track the total distance they have covered during their workout. The app calculates the distance based on the user's GPS location and provides an accurate measurement of the distance traveled. This information is useful for tracking progress and setting goals, as well as for determining the intensity of the workout.

**Duration**: The duration feature allows users to track the total time they have spent working out. This feature helps users to monitor the intensity of their workout and ensures that they are getting the most out of their exercise routine. The duration feature also helps users to track their overall workout consistency, which is a key factor in achieving fitness goals.

**Cadence**: The cadence feature allows users to track the number of steps they take per minute while running. This information is useful for tracking the user's running efficiency and helps them to identify areas for improvement. For example, if the user notices that their cadence is low, they can work on increasing it to improve their running performance.

**Pace**: The pace feature allows users to track their running speed and helps them monitor their progress over time. This feature helps users to adjust their pace according to their fitness level and ensures that they are not overexerting themselves. By tracking their pace, users can also monitor their progress and make adjustments to their workout routine as needed.

**Elevation Gain**: The elevation gain feature allows users to track the total amount of elevation they have gained while cycling. This information is useful for tracking the difficulty of the cycling route and for adjusting the workout accordingly. For example, if the user notices that their elevation gain is high, they may choose to take a different route or adjust the intensity of their workout.

**Speed**: The speed feature allows users to track their cycling speed and helps them monitor their progress over time. This feature helps users to adjust their speed according to their fitness level and ensures that they are not overexerting themselves. By tracking their speed, users can monitor their progress and make adjustments to their workout routine as needed.

**Storing data in local storage**: The app stores the workout data in the local storage of the user's browser, allowing them to save their data for future reference. This feature provides users with a secure and convenient way to save their workout data and monitor their progress over time. Users can view their past workout data and compare it to their current performance, which can help them set more realistic fitness goals and make informed decisions about their workout routine.
